pseudocode:

-- Pseudo for Object --
extend Frame, implement ActionListener and WindowListener
create GUI object called DiceGame, accept param for "title"
add FlowLayout
add text boxes
add buttons (one for player 1, one for player 2, one for stop rolling)
add WindowListener
add ActionListeners for those buttons
two text boxes are for the scores, 2 text boxes are for the outcome,

-- Pseudo for actionPerformed method --
int p1score
int p2score
while(p1score != 100 || p2score != 100)
randomize dice1 and dice2 from numbers 1-6
if one of them == 1, score for round is at 0
if both == 1. score goes to 0
if Stop Rolling is clicked, end round for that player. Display score in score1(p1) or score2(p2)
First to reach 100 wins

-- Pseudo for windowClosing method --
dispose()
System.exit(0)

-- Methods needed for WindowListener --
public void windowOpened(WindowEvent e) {}
public void windowActivated(WindowEvent e) {}
public void windowIconified(WindowEvent e) {}
public void windowDeiconified(WindowEvent e) {}
public void windowDeactivated(WindowEvent e) {}
public void windowClosed(WindowEvent e) {}


comments:

i'm gonna require a Dice object with 4 methods:
int getD1value()
int getD2value()
int roll()
int currentTotal()



you may want it to extend JPanel and display a pair of die image that change according to die values
